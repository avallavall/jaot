# JAOT — Just Another Optimization Tool

**A self-hostable optimization platform.** Describe a problem in natural
language or JSON, get the optimal solution back — no solver expertise required.
Build models with an AI assistant, share them in a marketplace, expose them to
AI agents over MCP, or just hit the REST API.

---

## What it is

JAOT wraps industrial MIP/LP solvers (SCIP, HiGHS) behind a multi-tenant API,
a visual builder, and an LLM formulation assistant. It is **a platform, not a
library and not a hosted SaaS** — you run it yourself with `docker compose up`.

- **Solver-agnostic core** — an `OptimizationProblem` schema that stays
  independent of the solver. Ships SCIP (via PySCIPOpt) and HiGHS (via highspy);
  an optional Hexaly adapter is bring-your-own-license.
- **LLM formulation assistant** — turn a natural-language description into a
  runnable model, grounded in a RAG index over the template library
  (Qdrant + local sentence-transformers; no data leaves your box except the
  Claude calls you opt into).
- **Model marketplace** — publish and activate pre-built models, priced in
  credits or free.
- **MCP server** — exposes solver tools to AI agents (Claude, etc.) via the
  Model Context Protocol.
- **102 templates + 27 problem generators** — knapsack, vehicle routing,
  scheduling, production planning, portfolio, a full MDPDP-TW formulation, and
  more.
- **Credits ledger, multi-tenant auth, admin panel, i18n (en/es/ca/fr/de),
  and a Prometheus/Grafana/Alertmanager monitoring stack** — included.

Payments are optional and bring-your-own Stripe keys: the billing code is
complete but **has never been exercised against live Stripe** — test before you
charge real money.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avallavall/jaot.git && cd jaot
cp .env.example .env   # includes first-run admin credentials — change the password
docker compose up -d   # migrates, seeds the catalog, creates your admin on first boot
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and log in with your `SEED_ADMIN_*` credentials — or
mint an API key and solve over HTTP:

```bash
docker compose exec api python scripts/ensure_admin_api_key.py   # prints your API key

curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v2/solve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"test","variables":[{"name":"x","type":"continuous","lower_bound":0,"upper_bound":10}],"objective":{"sense":"maximize","expression":"3*x"},"constraints":[{"name":"c1","expression":"x <= 5"}]}'
```

Returns `{"status":"optimal","objective_value":15.0,...}`. Full setup guide →
[docs/getting-started/QUICKSTART.md](docs/getting-started/QUICKSTART.md).

A **modular monolith**: the solver is the first extracted bounded context
(`app/domains/solver/`), behind a `SolverAdapter` protocol enforced by
import-linter contracts. Adding a solver means writing one adapter — see
[docs/ARCHITECTURE/OVERVIEW.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE/OVERVIEW.md).

## Built with

JAOT stands on the **[SCIP Optimization Suite](https://www.scipopt.org/)**
(Zuse Institute Berlin) and **[HiGHS](https://highs.dev/)** — full attributions
in [THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES).

Built solo and AI-accelerated. What you can verify rather than take on faith:
tests run against real PostgreSQL (no mocked DB), domain boundaries are enforced
by import-linter contracts, and every change is gated by lint, tests, and
security scans (`bandit`, `pip-audit`, `npm audit`). Details, coverage, and
mutation-test scores in [Testing & Quality](docs/TESTING.md).

**Maintained best-effort** — monthly issue triage, quarterly dependency/CVE
pass. Issues and focused PRs welcome; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
